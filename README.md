## What I've learned: 


Through this project, I explored the benefits of using Next.js for building applications. I also learned about server-side and client-side rendering.

Key topics learned with this project include:
-The structure of Next.js folders and files, including route creation and the concept of the layout file.
-Key Next.js components, particularly the Link and Image components.
-How to create client components and when to use them.
-Implementing dark mode by studying the Context component, which is used to share dark and light mode states across the entire application.

## What I've changed from the original project:

* design -
In order to improve the layout of this project, I made a few changes, such as adding border radius to images and using different colors for buttons and titles.

## How to run this project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
